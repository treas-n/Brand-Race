1. RETURN 5 CAR BRANDS & LOGOS IN 1 CALL
I believe this option is more suitable so that the client side and the server side do not have to keep going back and forth. With one request, we can fetch all the info we need from the server and work with it accordingly rather than calling from the server each time.

2. HOST IMAGES ON ANOTHER SITE
For my purposes, this was the better option, as the logos are of high quality and the Base64 encodings of some of the pictures was simply too long to store as text.
